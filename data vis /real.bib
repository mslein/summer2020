	abstract = {Increases in the frequency, severity and duration of temperature extremes are anticipated in the near future. Although recent work suggests that changes in temperature variation will have disproportionately greater effects on species than changes to the mean, much of climate change research in ecology has focused on the impacts of mean temperature change. Here, we couple fine-grained climate projections (2050–2059) to thermal performance data from 38 ectothermic invertebrate species and contrast projections with those of a simple model. We show that projections based on mean temperature change alone differ substantially from those incorporating changes to the variation, and to the mean and variation in concert. Although most species show increases in performance at greater mean temperatures, the effect of mean and variance change together yields a range of responses, with temperate species at greatest risk of performance declines. Our work highlights the importance of using fine-grained temporal data to incorporate the full extent of temperature variation when assessing and projecting performance.},

	abstract = {Thermal performance curves ({TPCs}), which quantify how an ectotherm’s body temperature (Tb) affects its performance or ﬁtness, are often used in an attempt to predict organismal responses to climate change. Here, we examine the key – but often biologically unreasonable – assumptions underlying this approach; for example, that physiology and thermal regimes are invariant over ontogeny, space and time, and also that {TPCs} are independent of previously experienced Tb. We show how a critical consideration of these assumptions can lead to biologically useful hypotheses and experimental designs. For example, rather than assuming that {TPCs} are ﬁxed during ontogeny, one can measure {TPCs} for each major life stage and incorporate these into stage-speciﬁc ecological models to reveal the life stage most likely to be vulnerable to climate change. Our overall goal is to explicitly examine the assumptions underlying the integration of {TPCs} with Tb, to develop a framework within which empiricists can place their work within these limitations, and to facilitate the application of thermal physiology to understanding the biological implications of climate change.},

We assume that the species are strongly interacting and that one or the other population is affected by the noise signal. Further assuming that a stable equilibrium with positive population densities exists, we are able to perform a complete frequency analysis of the system. If only one of the populations is subject to noise, the relative noise response by both populations is fully determined by the sign of a single element of the Jacobian matrix. The analysis is readily extended to cases when both species are affected by noise or when the food web has more than two species. The general conclusion about relative responses to noise is then less unambiguous, but the power spectra describing the frequency composition of the population variabilities are nevertheless completely determined. These results are entirely independent on the exact nature of the interaction (i.e., predation, competition, mutualism) between the populations. The results show that the interpretation of the ‘‘color’’ of ecological time series (i.e., the frequency composition of population variability over time) may be complicated by species interactions. The propagation of noise signals through food webs and the importance of web structure for the expected response of all parts of the web to such signals is a challenging ﬁeld for future studies.},

	abstract = {Developmental time data collected at constant temperatures poorly predicted developmental times of red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), and 16 other species at fluctuating temperatures over a broad range of mean temperatures or amplitudes of fluctuating temperatures. Developmental times at constant temperatures tended to be shorter above 25-30°C temperature range and longer below this range, than at fluctuating temperatures with the same means. Differences between developmental times at constant temperatures and those at fluctuating temperatures also tended to increase with the amplitude of fluctuating temperatures. Different methods were compared for predicting insect developmental times at fluctuating temperatures. One method made predictions by integrating constant temperature developmental time data over the 24-h fluctuating temperature cycle. This adjusts for the nonlinear relationship between temperature and developmental time. After making this adjustment, predictions were {\textgreater}40\% closer on average to observed developmental times at fluctuating temperatures. With developmental time data collected at fluctuating temperatures, temperature-development equations can be fitted over a broader range of temperatures above and below those favorable for survival of insects at constant temperatures. When these equations were used to do integration, predictions of developmental times at fluctuating temperatures were even better, improving by «70\%. Improvement may be a result partially of consideration of both the means and amplitudes of fluctuating temperatures in predicting developmental times. These methods provide an alternative to degree-day accumulation method for prediction of developmental times at fluctuating temperatures in the field.},

A nonlinear equation, the two-parameter form of the enzyme kinetic model of Sharpe \& {DeMichele} (1977), was used to describe the effect of constant temperatures on median nymphal development (egg hatch to adult eclosion). Although the nonlinear model underestimated developmental rates at two variable temperatures in the laboratory by 12 and 14\% and in the field by 25-32\%, its predictions were consistent enough to permit accurate predictions of developmental times.

In addition, feeding rate ({FR}), feeding efﬁciency ({FE}) and speciﬁc growth rate ({SGR}) were measured. The diel-ﬂuctuating temperature group showed lower {CTmin} than the 20 °C group but a similar {CTmax}, indicating a wider thermal scope. {SDA} linearly increased with the temperature. Temperature variation between 20 and 25 °C had little effect on either swimming or growth performance. However, ﬁsh in the 15 °C group exhibited much poorer swimming and growth performance than those in the 20 °C group. Ucrit decreased slightly under low acclimation temperature due to the pronounced improvement in swimming efﬁciency under cold temperature. Fish in the diel-ﬂuctuating temperature group fed more but exhibited similar {SGR} compared to 20 °C group, possibly due in part to an increase in energy expenditure to cope with the temperature ﬂuctuation. The narrower thermal scope and lower {CTmax} of Chinese bream together with the conservation of {CTmax} with temperature acclimation, suggests that local water temperature elevations may have more profound effects on Chinese bream than on other ﬁsh species in the Three Gorges Reservoir.},

	abstract = {The application of the sterile insect technique to fruit ﬂies involves the massproduction of the pest insects using an artiﬁcial diet, irradiation during a narrow time window at the late pupal or early imaginal stage to inhibit reproduction without affecting reproductive capacity, and then release into the target area where the sterile insects compete reproductively with their wild counterparts. The timing of irradiation is important to enable the release of males that are sterile but of good quality and exhibit an acceptable sexual performance. In this study, we examined the pupal development of 12 tephritid (Diptera: Tephritidae) species: Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann), A. ludens (Loew), A. obliqua (Macquart), A. serpentina (Wiedemann), Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett), B. dorsalis (Hendel), B. invadens (Drew, Tsuruta \& White), B. oleae (Rossi), B. philippinensis (Drew \& Hancock), B. tryoni (Froggatt), B. zonata (Saunders) and Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). The insects were reared at various temperatures, in the laboratory (15 – 28 8C) and under ﬂuctuating natural conditions (20 – 35 8C). The gradual colour changes of the insect eyes during metamorphosis were observed and photographed, measuring the speciﬁc eye colour parameters of each species and matching them with the colour scale of the Munsell Soil Color Charts. The duration of pupal development and the time to emergence in Anastrepha species were longer than those in C. capitata and Bactrocera species at all the holding temperatures. The data obtained can be used by mass-rearing facilities to manage pupal holding conditions and as indicators for optimizing the timing of irradiation.},

	abstract = {We incubated eggs of the soft-shell turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) at constant (ranging from 23 C to 34 C) and ﬂuctuating temperatures (varying from 22.3 C to 32.8 C) to assess inﬂuence of incubation thermal environments on duration of incubation, hatching success and hatchling traits likely affecting ﬁtness. Duration of incubation decreased as temperature increased, from 97.2 days at 23 C to 39.4 days at 34 C. Hatching success differed considerably among temperature treatments, with eggs incubated at lowest (23 C) and highest (34 C) temperatures exhibiting much lower hatching success (23 C: 44.0\%; 34 C: 73.7\%) than did those incubated at intermediate temperatures (81.7–96.9\%). Eggs incubated at different temperatures produced hatchlings that differed in both carapace width and body mass, with those incubated at 23 C producing the smallest hatchlings. Hatchlings from different incubation thermal environments did not differ each other in carapace width, but eggs incubated at ﬂuctuating temperatures produced the heaviest hatchlings, which were signiﬁcantly heavier than those derived from eggs incubated at 24 C, 33 C and 34 C. Within the range from 24 C to 33 C (including ﬂuctuating temperatures), hatchlings from 24 C performed more poorly in the racetrack than did those from higher incubation temperatures. Within the range from 26.5 C to 34 C, hatchlings from 26.5 C grew signiﬁcantly faster than did those from 34 C. The most noticeable advantage of incubating eggs at the ﬂuctuating temperature regime designed in this study is to widen the range of incubation temperatures yielding larger and well-performed hatchlings.},

	abstract = {Two of the principal explanations for regional population synchrony, largescale environmental variability and dispersal, have received considerable theoretical attention. Although time series analysis has helped to validate the relative importance of these two explanations, very little of this theory has been conﬁrmed by experiment. Here, we demonstrate the dual synchronizing effect of dispersal and temporal environmental variation. We used an experimental model system based on the rotifer Brachionus calyciﬂorus and its algal prey Chlorella vulgaris. We constructed temporal prey ﬂuctuations with two periodic components that matched the generation time and life span of the rotifer. By varying the amplitude of these two periods we created prey variability with ‘‘white’’ (both periods had equal power) and ‘‘red’’ (the longest period had greatest power) spectra. In the absence of dispersal only the red ﬂuctuations induced synchrony in the population dynamics of the rotifer. Dispersal had a strong and rapid synchronizing effect. The combination of red (but not white) ﬂuctuations and dispersal resulted in the highest levels of synchrony. These results conﬁrm the predictions of recent theory, but they also suggest that the temporal structure of environmental variability determines its capacity to synchronize population dynamics over large spatial scales.},

We test recent theory that suggests, surprisingly, that stochastic environmental variability may enhance the long-term persistence of sink metapopulations. Using experimental populations of Paramecium aurelia we show that it is possible for a metapopulation comprised entirely of sink populations to persist for many generations in a random environment. In accordance with the theory, we show that positive temporal autocorrelation and low spatial correlation in the environment can ensure the long-term persistence and enhance the mean and maximum abundance of sink metapopulations. High levels of spatial correlation in the environment created strong population synchrony and limited the persistence time of the sink metapopulations. These results have important implications for the development of a theory underlying the synergistic effects of habitat fragmentation and environmental change on population persistence.},

	abstract = {Resonance is an interaction between extrinsic environmental variability and intrinsic population processes that can raise population mean density or amplify environmental ﬂuctuations in systems with periodic environmental ﬂuctuations. This study empirically demonstrates signiﬁcant effects on population dynamics from resonance and describes the conditions under which they occur. In a laboratory microcosm experiment with the ciliate protist Colpidium striatum, resources were periodically alternated between high and low concentrations at different frequencies. Resonance raised the mean population density of rapidly ﬂuctuating treatments by 21\% compared to a constant control run at the average nutrient concentration, and eventually approximated the mean density of the highest nutrient control. The resonant resource perturbations occurred on a time scale intermediate to the reproduction and starvation rates of the organisms. It is likely that metabolic nonlinearities in these reproductive and starvation responses interacted with the periodic resources ﬂuctuations of intermediate frequency to produce the population boost through the cumulative storage of resources in the cells of the protists. The populations also showed a frequency threshold effect in the translation of environmental variability into population variability. The patterns of population abundance and variability observed in this experiment indicate that resonance between intrinsic and extrinsic processes may be an important factor to consider in population dynamics.},

Temporally autocorrelated variability can increase abundance of the inferior species through effects on demography, the strength of competition, and the mean and variance in the abundance of competing species. We allowed the competitive inferior to immigrate into habitats with constant, variable, or temporally autocorrelated temperature regimes. In the absence of immigration, competitive exclusion occurred, in both constant and variable environments. Immigration permitted persistence of the inferior species, and increased immigration rates led to increased abundance. Temporally autocorrelated variability enhanced this effect of immigration. This Ô{inﬂationaryÕ} effect suggests that the interplay of immigration and environmental variability can jointly inﬂuence the outcome of competitive interactions. Our results suggest that an increase in temporal autocorrelation of environmental variability will cause regional processes to increasingly inﬂuence local interactions.},

	abstract = {Adding ﬂuctuations to models of resource competition provides one solution to Hutchinson’s paradox. Fundamental to ﬂuctuation dependent mechanisms of coexistence are differential species’ responses to environmental ﬂuctuations through time. The covariance between the environment and competition this generates leads to compensatory population dynamics, now thought to be important for community stability. We tested this theory experimentally using freshwater diatoms. We measured the growth of Cyclotella pseudostelligera and Fragilaria crotonensis over a range of temperatures. Cyclotella showed a higher growth rate and higher silicate assimilation rate between 6{ЊC} and 18{ЊC}, while Fragilaria showed greater competitive ability above 18{ЊC}. These results were used to parameterize a resource competition model. Numerical simulation of this model predicted stable coexistence and compensatory dynamics under ﬂuctuating but not constant temperature. A long-term competition experiment with Cyclotella and Fragilaria conﬁrmed the predictions of the model. These results demonstrate the role abiotic ﬂuctuations may play in maintaining the diversity of natural communities.},
